#LibraryManagementSystem

Design and implement a Java-based Library Management System using Servlets that allows users to manage library records efficiently.
The system enables users to add books and view books stored in the database. The application uses two relational tables — Book and Author — 
to maintain proper data organization and relationships.The system demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation,
modular design, MVC architecture, JDBC connectivity, and exception handling while providing a dynamic web-based interface using Servlets.

How to Compile and Run:
Clone the repository and move into the project folder: git clone https://github.com/your-username/LibraryManagementSystem.git
cd LibraryManagementSystem ,Import the project into your IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ).
Configure Apache Tomcat Server and attach it to the project. Update database credentials inside your DB connection class (e.g., DBConnection.java).
Build and deploy the project on Tomcat Server. Start the server and open your browser:
http://localhost:8080/LibraryManagementSystem/
This will start the Servlet-based Library Management System web application.
